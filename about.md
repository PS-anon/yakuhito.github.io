Since a lot of people [have already doxed me](https://ctftime.org/task/10045), here's some info you might be interested in.

### Travel
I prefer the comfort of my sofa, but sometimes certain people trick me into leaving it temporarily. Here's a (hopefully updated) map of the places I've been to:

### Tea

I really don't like coffee. However, I consider myself a tea addict. My favourite flavour is orange & rooibos. If you want to make me happy, any tea will do the trick.

### Science Fiction

My favourite author is Isaac Asimov, closely followed by exurb1a. Also, if I managed to configure the site correctly, the light theme should contain a lot of Hooloovoo.

### Guitar

Please, don't ask me to sing anything. Thank you.

### Full-time Cat Owner

Cats. The Ancient Egyptians held them in the highest esteem. Cats are going to rule the world some day. Until then, I take pride in being the slave of my feline companions.

### Twitter Personality

I like to think that I'm pretty popular on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yakuh1t0). My follower count isn't high, but at least I managed to pass 100 followers.

### Capture-The-Flag Contests

This is probably why you are here. In 2019, I was a member of [C0Br@](https://ctftime.org/team/70205). The same year I moved to [HTsP](https://ctftime.org/team/58218), and I've been playing CTFs with them ever since. HTsP is like a second family to me and I don't plan on leaving them anytime soon.

I was also a member of Romania's 2019 ECSC team, which [managed to win the first place in the finals](https://ecsc.eu/archive). With some luck, I'll qualify for the 2020 team as well.

### Hack The Box

After getting my OSCP, I started rooting boxes on HTB. You can find my profile below.
